## About Scale

![](images/NGEN_Scale.png){align=right}
Because NGEN is designed with live performance in mind, most of the Generators process notes in terms of musical intervals rather than specific notes. Therefore these Generators use the selected **Key** and **Scale** in the **SCALE** sub-menu to translate those intervals to the appropriate notes.

This approach lets the user change the **Key** and **Scale** of all **[Tracks](track.md)** simultaneously via the **SCALE** sub-menu (available in the **MAIN MENU**).

A global Octave control is also available under the Scale sub-menu.
