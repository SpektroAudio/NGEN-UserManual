## About NGEN

```NGEN``` is the first AMW (Algorithmic MIDI Workstation) available in the market and it's capable of sequencing up to 16 MIDI-enabled instruments via MIDI or USB. 

It works similarly to standard MIDI sequencers except that, instead of having to record and edit sequences manually, ```NGEN``` let's you use different Generators to create and manipulate MIDI sequences in real time.

```NGEN``` offers a unique music experience for artists, live performers and music products because it abstracts the composition process by using different algorithms to create different kinds of sequence, freeing the artist / performer to focus on the curation and manipulation of these sequences. It is as if it was a video in game in which the user has the chance of being the maestro of a virtual orchestra composed of some of the best skilled improv musicians instead of being one of the musicians in the orchestra.
