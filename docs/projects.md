##About Projects

Similarly to standard DAWs, NGEN can save and load entire sessions as project files. These files are stored in the microSD as .HEX files inside the Projects folder.

A project file contains data for [Tracks](track.md) (including data for the active [**Generators**](generators.md), [**MIDI FX**](midifx.md) and I/O routings), [**Clock Generators**](clockgen.md), [**Scale**](scale.md), Perform Mode, and [**Patterns**](pattern.md).

After saving or loading a project, that project becomes the active project for all [Patterns](pattern.md).

To **save a project**, navigate to the Projects sub-menu, select the Save File option, and select what file you'd like to save your project to.

To **load a project**, navigate to the Projects sub-menu, select the Load File option, and select what file you'd like to load.

To **create a new project** file, navigate to the Projects sub-menu, select the New File option, edit the file name, and confirm.

Projects can not be renamed through NGEN's interface. To rename a project, connect the microSD card to your computer (via a microSD to USB adapter) and rename the files inside the Projects folder (we suggest limiting the filename to 10 characters).
