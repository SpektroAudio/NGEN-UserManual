## Getting Started with NGEN

To get started with NGEN simply connect it to a computer or another USB-host device via USB or a MIDI-capable device via the MIDI Out jack.

Because the [MIDI Clock](clockgen.md#midi-clock) generator is active by default, you only need to send a MIDI Clock from a DAW or external gear to NGEN. 

By default, all 16 tracks are set up to output MIDI from channels 1 to 16 sequentially however only the first track is active when the device is turned on (more tracks can be enabled via the [Track Settings](track.md#track-settings)).

## Step-By-Step Guide

Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started with NGEN:

1. Connect NGEN to a [computer](setup.md#connecting-via-usb) or a [MIDI](setup.md#connecting-via-midi)-capable hardware instrument. If you don't plan on using NGEN with a computer you can [power the unit externally](setup.md#powering-ngen-externally). 

2. Set your MIDI instrument/destination to receive MIDI notes on Channel #1:

      1. If you're using NGEN with a computer, open your DAW of choice, create an instrument / MIDI track, load a virtual instrument, and set it to receive MIDI from Channel 1.

      2. If you're using a hardware synthesizer, check if it's set to receive MIDI on Channel 1.

3. Start one of the NGEN's [Clock Generators](clockgen.md):

      1. If you'd like to sync NGEN to a MIDI Clock coming from your DAW or instrument, make sure that they're set to output MIDI Clock to NGEN via USB or the MIDI IN jack.
      2. If you'd like to use NGEN's internal clock go to the [Main Menu](menunavegation.md#main-menu), navigate to the Clock sub-menu, hold the ++"TRACK / CLK"++ button and move the ++"MENU ENCODER"++ to select the Free Clock, and click the encoder to set it's status to active.

4. NGEN should now start sending MIDI Notes to your instrument.
 
5. By default, NGEN will load ACDGEN as the [generator](generators.md) for [track #1](track.md). To control ACDGEN's settings, return to the [Main Menu](menunavegation.md#main-menu) by pressing the ++"RETURN"++ button and navigate to the [Generator](generators.md) sub-menu.

## Flow Diagram

The NGEN sequencing engine works by using having a clock generator trigger the tracks' generators and MIDI FXs.

The notes generated by each track's generator and MIDI FX are routed to the track's main and auxiliary output. The MIDI output of all tracks are sent to external instruments via the USB and MIDI (A-style 1/8" jack) ports.
