## Getting Started with NGEN

To get started with NGEN, simply connect it to a computer or another USB-host device via USB or to a MIDI-capable device via the MIDI Out jack.

The [MIDI Clock](clockgen.md#midi-clock) generator is active by default so NGEN should be ready to receive MIDI Clock from a DAW or external gear to NGEN. 

By default, all 16 tracks are set up to output MIDI to channels 1 through 16 sequentially however only the first track is active when the device is turned on (more tracks can be enabled via the [Track Settings](track.md#track-settings)). 


!!! warning "Attention - ADVANCED MODE"
      Many advanced settings (such as track routing and Clock Rate) are hidden by default to provide a more streamlined experience to new users.   
      To access these settings, enable the "Advanced Mode" in the [Settings](settings.md) / General page.

## Step-By-Step Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step process to initiate NGEN:

1. Establish a connection between NGEN and a [computer](setup.md#connecting-via-usb) or a [MIDI](setup.md#connecting-via-midi)-enabled hardware instrument. If you do not intend to use NGEN with a computer, you can [power the unit externally](setup.md#powering-ngen-externally).

2. Configure your MIDI instrument or destination to receive MIDI notes on Channel #1:

      1. If you're utilizing NGEN with a computer, launch your preferred DAW, create an instrument/MIDI track, load a virtual instrument, and set it to receive MIDI from NGEN's Channel 1.

      2. If you're employing a hardware synthesizer, ensure it's configured to receive MIDI on Channel 1.

3. Initiate one of NGEN's [Clock Generators](clockgen.md):

      1. If you wish to synchronize NGEN to a MIDI Clock from your DAW or instrument, ensure they're configured to output MIDI Clock to NGEN via USB or the MIDI IN jack.
      
      2. If you prefer to use NGEN's internal clock, navigate to the [Main Menu](menunavigation.md#main-menu), proceed to the Clock sub-menu, hold the ++"TRACK / CLK"++ button and move the ++"MENU ENCODER"++ to select the Free Clock, then click the encoder to activate it.

4. NGEN should now begin transmitting MIDI Notes to your instrument.

5. By default, NGEN will load ACDGEN as the [generator](generators.md) for [track #1](track.md). To modify ACDGEN's settings, navigate back to the [Main Menu](menunavigation.md#main-menu) by pressing the ++"RETURN"++ button and proceed to the [Generator](generators.md) sub-menu.

## Flow Diagram

The NGEN sequencing engine works by having a clock generator trigger the tracks' generators and MIDI FXs.

The notes generated by each track's generator and MIDI FX are routed to the track's main and auxiliary output. The MIDI output of all tracks is sent to external instruments via the USB and MIDI (A-style 1/8" jack) ports.
