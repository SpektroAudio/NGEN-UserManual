This mode will play loops sliced in 1/16 in their original form. Mode 1 (Backward): Similar to Mode 0 (Forward) except it'll play the slices in reverse/backward. Mode 2 (Sequenced): This mode uses a shuffled sequence to play the slices in a different order to create new variations of the loop.

Because the MIDI Clock generator is active by default, you only need to send a MIDI Clock from a DAW or external gear to NGEN. By default, all 16 tracks are set up to output MIDI from channels 1 to 16 sequentially however only the first track is active when the device is turned on (more tracks can be enabled via the Track Settings ). Step-By-Step Guide Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started with NGEN: Connect NGEN to a computer or a MIDI -capable hardware instrument. If you don't plan on using NGEN with a computer you can power the unit externally . Set your MIDI instrument/destination to receive MIDI notes on Channel #1: If you're using NGEN with a computer, open your DAW of choice, create an instrument / MIDI track, load a virtual instrument, and set it to receive MIDI from Channel 1. If you're using a hardware synthesizer, check if it's set to receive MIDI on Channel 1. Start one of the NGEN's Clock Generators : If you'd like to sync NGEN to a MIDI Clock coming from your DAW or instrument, make sure that they're set to output MIDI Clock to NGEN via USB or the MIDI IN jack. If you'd like to use NGEN's internal clock go to the Main Menu , navigate to the Clock sub-menu, hold the TRACK / CLK button and move the MENU ENCODER to select the Free Clock, and click the encoder to set it's status to active. NGEN should now start sending MIDI Notes to your instrument. By default, NGEN will load ACDGEN as the generator for track #1 . To control ACDGEN's settings, return to the Main Menu by pressing the RETURN button and navigate to the Generator sub-menu. Flow Diagram The NGEN sequencing engine works by using having a clock generator trigger the tracks' generators and MIDI FXs. The notes generated by each track's generator and MIDI FX are routed to the track's main and auxiliary output. The MIDI output of all tracks are sent to external instruments via the USB and MIDI (A-style 1/8\" jack) ports. graph LR A[CLOCK GENERATOR] --> B[TRACK 1] --> C[GENERATOR] --> D[MIDI FX] --> E[TRACK OUTPUT] -->|CH 1| F[USB / MIDI OUT]; A-->G[TRACK 2] --> H[GENERATOR] --> I[MIDI FX] --> J[TRACK OUTPUT] -->|CH 2| F; A-->K[TRACK 3] --> L[GENERATOR] --> M[MIDI FX] --> N[TRACK OUTPUT] -->|CH 3| F;","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#getting-started-with-ngen","text":"To get started with NGEN simply connect it to a computer or another USB-host device via USB or a MIDI-capable device via the MIDI Out jack.

This lets you automate parameters during a live set or even use an external MIDI controller to access certain parameters directly. MIDI CC messages are routed to Tracks according to their IN CH (MIDI Input Channel) settings. The values received are processed depending on the behaviour of the parameter / setting / action (check MIDI chart below). The different behaviours are: Scaled: values 0-127 are scaled to the parameter's minimum and maximum range. Action: values greater than zero trigger the action. Absolute: the value is used directly according to the range described (values outside of the described range are ignored). Because NGEN uses MIDI Channel 16 for global settings, tracks set to IN CH 16 will only receive MIDI notes.

Patterns can store and recall settings for all tracks (including their Generators and MIDI FX). Global and clock settings are only stored in Projects . Each Project can store up to 8 patterns. To use patterns, you must first activate a Project by either saving or loading from the microSD card via the PROJECT sub-menu. Once a project is active, you can save and recall different patterns. To load a pattern , press the PATTERN button once to open the Pattern Selector , select the pattern using the MENU ENCODER , and click on the encoder to load.

To save a pattern , return to the Main Menu, hold down PATTERN + FUNCTION , and press the encoder. Saving a pattern automatically overwrites that pattern in the active Project file therefore it's not necessary to save the Project afterward.

These connections can also be used simultaniously. Connecting via USB The simplest way to use NGEN is to connect it to your computer via USB. The USB connection powers the unit and it's capable of sending and receiving MIDI since it works as a Class Compliant MIDI device. Connecting via MIDI NGEN can also be connected to other gear via the MIDI IN and MIDI OUT 3.5mm TRS jacks (Type-A). Please note that NGEN still needs to be powered via USB (check the Powering NGEN section below). Connecting via CV NGEN also features 2 pairs of CV + Gate outputs that can be used to sequence 1V/OCT synthesizers / modules. To enable the CV output ports, set the AUX OUT of any of Tracks to CV1 or CV2. The CV and GATE outputs on NGEN have a limited range of 3.3V and a resolution of 12bits so we recommend using an external MIDI to CV converter for a wider range and better resolution. ATTENTION: The CV and Gate jacks are OUTPUTS only. Do not send any CV signals into them or you may run the risk of damaging your unit. Please note that NGEN still needs to be powered via USB (check the Powering NGEN section below). Powering NGEN externally If you'd like to set up NGEN without a computer, you can power it using a USB power bank / battery or a standard USB wall charger. NGEN's power consumption is minimal so even a 0.5A charger should work.

Each track can be set to a different Generator , MIDI FX , Program Change and I/O settings. The track settings can be accessed via the TRACK sub-menu available in the MAIN MENU or via the FUNCTION + TRACK shortcut . Selecting a Track To select a different track, press the TRACK / CLK button, use the MENU ENCODER to scroll through the different tracks and press the MENU ENCODER or the RETURN button to return to the previous screen. Alternatively, turn the MENU ENCODER while holding down the TRACK / CLK button to automatically return to the previous screen. When a new track is selected, it automatically becomes the active track, meaning the four NGEN knobs (as well as the GENERATE button) will affect its parameters. Tracks Internal Routing When triggered by a Clock Generator , a track will trigger the selected Generator . The MIDI output of the Generator is then sent to the input of the selected MIDI FX . The MIDI output of the MIDI FX is then sent to the track's main and auxiliary outputs. The main output is always routed to the USB / MIDI Out on the selected MIDI channel (OUT CH). The auxiliary output can be used for sending MIDI messages generated by a track (post MIDI FX) to the input of another track or one of the CV outputs . Tracks can also receive MIDI from external sources (via USB or MIDI IN) and other tracks (routed via the AUX OUT).
