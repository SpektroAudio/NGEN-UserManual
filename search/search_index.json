Instead of writing sequences from scratch, NGEN lets you quickly generate a new sequence for your drums, basslines, melodies, and chord progressions with a push of a button.</p> <p>NGEN includes classic Spektro Audio generators (ACDGEN and Polyform), completely new algorithmic generators (Drumgen, Samba, Arper, MARP, Pop, Turing, Shuffler), and  practical generators (Input Sequencer, MIDI Player, Thru).Each generator features an algorithm to combine different composition techniques with randomness so each generated sequence is unique.After generating a sequence, you can tweak it in real time using the parameters available for each of the generators. Take things even further by applying MIDI FXs such as Chord or Glitch to your sequences.All tracks in NGEN follow the same key and scale so it\u2019s easier to get multiple sequences that work well with each other.Quickly save and restore your creations using patterns and projects stored in the microSD card.</p> <p>NGEN's design is primarily focused on live performance so it features a 1.3\" OLED screen, a minimalistic and easy to read interface, mechanical switches (Gateron Green), shortcuts for accessing different features, per track Program Change selector and auto-variation, extensive MIDI CC implementation, and a Performance mode for controlling up to 4 parameters at the same time.</p> <p>NGEN also includes a variety of tools to let you explore this world of algorithmic sequencing such as assignable CV outputs, a built-in MIDI monitor, different clock generators, and much more.</p> <p>Product Page: http://spektroaudio.com/ngen</p> <p>Video Tutorials: NGEN Playlist on Youtube</p> <p>Download PDF</p> <p>Print Current Version</p>"},{"location":"#firmware","title":"Firmware","text":"<p>Current version: 1.3 (Change-Log)</p>"},{"location":"clockgen/","title":"Clock Generators","text":""},{"location":"clockgen/#about-clock-generators","title":"About Clock Generators","text":"<p>NGEN includes 3 clock generators that can be used for clocking all 16 tracks. </p> <p>Each clock generator has a separate clock count and can trigger all tracks relative to it.

This approach allows you to combine different Generators and MIDI FX to create more intricate and complex sequences.</p> <p>To achieve this, simply set the Output Channel of all tracks to the same value. From there, you can use the second track to add or modify the notes generated by the first track.</p> <p>Here's a list of some great combinations that we've found during our testing:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DRUMGEN + Samba: DrumGen can be used to sequence the main elements of your drum section (kick, snare, hihats) while Samba can sequence other percussive elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>POP + Arper: In this combination, POP can be used to generate the main chord progression while Arper can be used to add a repeating arpeggio pattern on top of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>2X ACDGEN: Two ACDGEN tracks can be combined to create more intricate sequences. Try setting the 2 ACDGEN tracks to different algorithms and/or octaves for more interesting results.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Extra tips for combining multiple tracks:</p> <ul> <li>Use different clock rates for each track (1/16 and 1/8 for example).</li> <li>Explore contrasting settings for the generators.
