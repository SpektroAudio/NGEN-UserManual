It offers a completely new way of creating and performing music by abstracting the composition process. Instead of writing sequences from scratch, NGEN lets you quickly generate a new sequence for your drums, basslines, melodies, and chord progressions with a push of a button. NGEN includes classic Spektro Audio generators (ACDGEN and Polyform), completely new algorithmic generators (Drumgen, Samba, Arper, MARP, Pop, Turing, Shuffler), and practical generators (Input Sequencer, MIDI Player, Thru).Each generator features an algorithm to combine different composition techniques with randomness so each generated sequence is unique.After generating a sequence, you can tweak it in real time using the parameters available for each of the generators. Take things even further by applying MIDI FXs such as Chord or Glitch to your sequences.All tracks in NGEN follow the same key and scale so it\u2019s easier to get multiple sequences that work well with each other.Quickly save and restore your creations using patterns and projects stored in the microSD card. NGEN's design is primarily focused on live performance so it features a 1.3\" OLED screen, a minimalistic and easy to read interface, mechanical switches (Gateron Green), shortcuts for accessing different features, per track Program Change selector and auto-variation, extensive MIDI CC implementation, and a Performance mode for controlling up to 4 parameters at the same time. NGEN also includes a variety of tools to let you explore this world of algorithmic sequencing such as assignable CV outputs, a built-in MIDI monitor, different clock generators, and much more.

Each generator uses a specific algorithm to create a unique MIDI sequence based on certain ideas, musical styles, and production techniques. These sequences can then be modified and interacted with via the different parameters available in each generator. The output of each generator is routed to the Track 's both MIDI out and Aux Out (which can be used to send MIDI notes from one track to another). Each track can load any of the available generators. Info The animations for each generator are displayed via the Idle Mode feature while in the Generator sub-menu. To see the animations, set Idle Mode is set to Animation in the Settings , navigate to the Generator sub-menu and leave the machine idle until the display switch to the Idle Mode.

The MIDI Clock generator is active by default so NGEN should be ready to receive MIDI Clock from a DAW or external gear to NGEN. By default, all 16 tracks are set up to output MIDI to channels 1 through 16 sequentially however only the first track is active when the device is turned on (more tracks can be enabled via the Track Settings ). Attention - ADVANCED MODE Many advanced settings (such as track routing and Clock Rate) are hidden by default to provide a more streamlined experience to new users. To access these settings, enable the \"Advanced Mode\" in the Settings / General page. To keep your current settings, save your settings after enabling Advanced Mode. Step-By-Step Guide This guide provides a step-by-step process to initiate NGEN: 1 - Connecting NGEN to your setup In this first section, you'll learn how to connect NGEN to your setup and use it to sequence 1 instrument using the ACDGEN generator. Establish a connection between NGEN and a computer or a MIDI -enabled hardware instrument. If you do not intend to use NGEN with a computer, you can power the unit externally . Configure your MIDI instrument or destination to receive MIDI notes on Channel #1: If you're utilizing NGEN with a computer, launch your preferred DAW, create an instrument/MIDI track, load a virtual instrument, and set it to receive MIDI from NGEN's Channel 1. If you're employing a hardware synthesizer, ensure it's configured to receive MIDI on Channel 1. Initiate one of NGEN's Clock Generators : If you wish to synchronize NGEN to a MIDI Clock from your DAW or instrument, ensure they're configured to output MIDI Clock to NGEN via USB or the MIDI IN jack. If you prefer to use NGEN's internal clock, navigate to the Main Menu , proceed to the Clock sub-menu, hold the TRACK / CLK button and move the MENU ENCODER to select the Free Clock, then click the encoder to activate it. NGEN should now begin transmitting MIDI Notes to your instrument. By default, NGEN will load ACDGEN as the generator for track #1 so you should hear a sequence being played on your instrument. 2 - Generating and Modifying Sequences Using ACDGEN Now that NGEN is connected and transmitting MIDI notes to your instrument, let's see how to generate and modify sequences using the ACDGEN generator. Attention The first 3 sub-menus available in the Main Menu (Generator, MIDI FX and Track) are related to the selected track while the other sub-menus contain global settings. Return to the Main Menu using the RETURN button and navigate to the Generator sub-menu . This sub-menu contains all the parameters available for the active generator in the selected track (in this case, ACDGEN). Note While in the Generator sub-menu, the NGEN displays the name of the active generator in the top-left corner and the selected track number in the right corner. Use the MENU ENCODER to scroll through the parameter list . To modify the value of the selected parameter, click the MENU ENCODER to select the value, scroll to adjust it, and click the encoder to return to the parameter selection. The main 4 parameters of the active generator can also be accessed through the PARAM 1-4 potentiometers (except while in certain sub-menus). Additional 4 parameters can be accessed by holding the FUNCTION button and turning the PARAM 1-4 potentiometers. More information about the behavior of the potentiometers can be found in the Hardware Controls section. To generate a new sequence, click the GENERATE button. For more information about Generators, check the Generators section. 3 - Activating a MIDI FX Let's try adding a MIDI FX to the active track to modify the sequence generated by ACDGEN in real time. From the Main Menu , navigate to the Track sub-menu to access the track's parameters. This sub-menu lets you activate/deactivate the track, select the active generator and MIDI FX, and adjust settings related to MIDI routing, clock division, and more. Navigate to the MIDI FX parameter and click the MENU ENCODER to select the desired MIDI FX. Scroll through the list of available MIDI FXs using the MENU ENCODER , select the Glitch MIDI FX, and click the encoder to confirm. Return to the Main Menu and navigate to the MIDI FX sub-menu to access the parameters of the active MIDI FX. Attention While in the MIDI FX sub-menu, PARAM 1-4 potentiometers control the parameters of the active MIDI FX as indicated by the knob icon on the top of the screen. For more information about MIDI FXs, check the MIDI FX section. 4 - Adding More Tracks Because NGEN is a multi-track sequencer, you can switch between tracks to edit their parameters and sequences. Let's add a new track and configure it to output MIDI notes to Channel 2. To open the track selector, click the TRACK|CLK button from the Main Menu or any sub-menu. Use the MENU ENCODER to scroll through the list of available tracks, select track #2, and click the encoder to confirm. Use the shortcut FUNCTION + TRACK to jump to the Track sub-menu . Only track 1 is active by default, so activate track 2 by scrolling to the Active parameter and clicking the MENU ENCODER to toggle it on. Navigate to the Generator parameter and select a different generator for track 2. By default, the 16 tracks available in NGEN are set to output MIDI notes to channels 1 through 16 sequentially. To access the parameters related to MIDI routing, clock division, and more, enable the Advanced Mode in the Settings / General page. For more information about tracks, check the Track section. 5 - Using Patterns NGEN allows you to create and store 8 patterns per project. In this section, you'll learn how to save and load patterns. Click the PATTERN button to open the Pattern selector. Use the MENU ENCODER to scroll through the list of available pattern slots. To quickly save your active sequence to a pattern slot, press FUNCTION + PATTERN . To load a pattern, scroll to the desired pattern slot and click the MENU ENCODER . To access the pattern slot settings, click FUNCTION + PATTERN while in the pattern selector. This sub-menu lets you save, delete, copy and paste patterns. For more information about patterns, check the Pattern section. 6 - Saving Your Project In this final section, you'll learn how to save your project for future use. Attention Projects can be stored in the internal memory of NGEN or on an external microSD card. To save your project to the internal memory, ensure that the microSD card is not inserted. Return to the Main Menu and navigate to the Project sub-menu. Scroll to the Save parameter and click the MENU ENCODER to save your project. Edit the project name using the MENU ENCODER and confirm. For more information about projects, check the Project section. Flow Diagram The NGEN sequencing engine works by having a clock generator trigger the tracks' generators and MIDI FXs.

language. At it's core, the NSL Engine features a 32-step sequence (with individual pitch, velocity, length (in beats) and density per step) and standard parameters such Shift, Length and Density to control playback. Instead of using a pre-defined algorithm to fill the 32-step sequence, the NSL Engine lets you load a script to generate it using your own custom algorithm. Each NSL script consists of a series of hex values that are parsed into commands and values. Hex values above 160 (0xA0) trigger new commands and values below 160 are assigned as values / parameters for these commands. The engine also includes 32 registers (Memory Buffer) that can be used to store values and use them later in the script and 4 generic parameters (Param 1-4) with ranges from 0-100. Warning The NSL Engine is still in beta and it's not fully documented and implemented yet. This section of the manual will be updated as we continue to develop the NSL Engine. Faulty scripts can cause the NSL Engine to crash and require a reboot. ngen_nsl Rust Library ngen_nsl is a custom Rust library available via cargo / crates.io that make it easier to create and parse NSL scripts for the NSL Engine. To add it to your Rust project, run the command cargo add ngen_nsl in your project's directory. Documentation for ngen_nsl is available at https://docs.rs/ngen_nsl . NSL Programming Reference Parameter Types NSL commands require set of different parameters to execute correctly and each parameter's value is used according to the list below: VALUE The VALUE parameter type returns a constant values from 0x00 to 0x7F (0-127) and values stored in the NSL Engine's memory buffer from 0x80 to 0x9F (128-159). DESTINATION / SOURCE The DESTINATION / SOURCE parameters consists of 2 x VALUE parameters that are used in pair to retrieve values from different parts and features of the NSL Engine. SOURCE parameters are used to retrieve data while DESTINATION parameters are used to set data. The first VALUE in the pair (aka VALUE 1 ) is used to indicate the type / location of the value that follows it ( VALUE 2 ) according to the table below: PART / FEATURE VALUE 1 (Address) VALUE 2 (Value / Index) VALUE 2 RANGE SOURCE DESTINATION DESTINATION RANGE Constant Value 0x00 Value 0-127 \u2714\ufe0e \u2715 N/A Random Value 0x01 Random Range 0-127 \u2714\ufe0e \u2715 N/A Step Pitch 0x02 Step Number (Zero-Indexed) 0-31 \u2714\ufe0e \u2714\ufe0e 0-127 (MIDI PITCH) Step Velocity 0x03 Step Number (Zero-Indexed) 0-31 \u2714\ufe0e \u2714\ufe0e 0-127 (MIDI VELOCITY) Step Length 0x04 Step Number (Zero-Indexed) 0-31 \u2714\ufe0e \u2714\ufe0e 0-32 (BEATS) Step Density 0x05 Step Number (Zero-Indexed) 0-31 \u2714\ufe0e \u2714\ufe0e 0-49 Memory Buffer 0x06 Step Number (Zero-Indexed) 0-31 \u2714\ufe0e \u2714\ufe0e 0-255 Params 1-4 0x07 Parameter Number (Zero-Indexed) 0-3 \u2714\ufe0e \u2714\ufe0e 0-100 Scale 0x08 Note position in scale 0-127 \u2714\ufe0e \u2715 N/A Scale (Quantized) 0x09 Note position in scale 0-127 \u2714\ufe0e \u2715 N/A Some features such as Constant and Random use the second VALUE in the pair ( VALUE 2 ) as the actual value while the other types use it as an index to indicate the location of the value in the NSL Engine's memory. Examples: 0x00 0x05 : Returns a constant value ( ORIGIN = 0x00 ) of 5 ( VALUE = 0x05 ). 0x02 0x10 : Returns the step pitch ( ORIGIN = 0x02 ) at index 16 ( VALUE = 0x10 ). 0x07 0x20 : Returns a random value ( ORIGIN = 0x07 ) between 0 and 32 (VALUE = 0x20 ). INT16 The INT16 parameter type uses a pair (x and y) of 8-bit values (0-255) to create a 16-bit value (0-65535) by shifting the first value 8 bits to the left and adding the second value to it ( (x << 8) + y ). List of Commands 0xA1 SET Description: Sets the value of a destination to the value of a source.

At it's core, the NSL Engine features a 32-step sequence (with individual pitch, velocity, length (in beats) and density per step) and standard parameters such Shift, Length and Density to control playback. Instead of using a pre-defined algorithm to fill the 32-step sequence, the NSL Engine lets you load a script to generate it using your own custom algorithm. Each NSL script consists of a series of hex values that are parsed into commands and values. Hex values above 160 (0xA0) trigger new commands and values below 160 are assigned as values / parameters for these commands. The engine also includes 32 registers (Memory Buffer) that can be used to store values and use them later in the script and 4 generic parameters (Param 1-4) with ranges from 0-100. Warning The NSL Engine is still in beta and it's not fully documented and implemented yet. This section of the manual will be updated as we continue to develop the NSL Engine.

Patterns can store and recall settings for all tracks (including their Generators and MIDI FX). Global and clock settings are only stored in Projects . Each Project contains 8 pattern slots that can be saved, copied, pasted, and deleted from the Pattern Selector menu (accessible via the PATTERN button). The Pattern Selector displays the active pattern on the left ( ACTIVE ), the selected pattern on the center ( NEXT ) and the Generator and MIDI FX selected for the first 3 active tracks. Loading / Queuing Patterns NGEN offer 3 methods for loading / queuing patterns: 1 - Press the PATTERN button to open the Pattern Selector, select the pattern using the MENU ENCODER and click on the encoder to load. 2 - Turn the MENU ENCODER while holding down the PATTERN button to select a pattern, release the button to load the selected pattern. 3 - Use the shortcuts PATTERN + GENERATE to load the next pattern in the sequence or PATTERN + FUNCTION + GENERATE to load the previous pattern in the sequence. Patterns are queued and loaded at the beginning of the next bar if NGEN is playing or immediately if NGEN is stopped. Saving Patterns The changes you make in NGEN are not automatically saved to the current pattern to avoid accidental overwriting of patterns. To save the current pattern to one of the available slots, follow these steps: 1 - Open the Pattern Selector by pressing the PATTERN button. 2 - Select which pattern slot you'd like to save the current pattern to by turning the MENU ENCODER . 3 - Open the Pattern Edit menu by holding down the FUNCTION button and pressing the PATTERN button. 4 - Select the Save option to save the current pattern to the selected slot. It's also possible to use the shortcut PATTERN + MENU ENCODER to save the current pattern to the selected slot while in the Pattern Selector.

These connections can also be used simultaniously. Connecting via USB The simplest way to use NGEN is to connect it to your computer via USB. The USB connection powers the unit and it's capable of sending and receiving MIDI since it works as a Class Compliant MIDI device. Connecting via MIDI NGEN can also be connected to other gear via the MIDI IN and MIDI OUT 3.5mm TRS jacks (Type-A). Please note that NGEN still needs to be powered via USB (check the Powering NGEN section below). Connecting via CV NGEN also features 2 pairs of CV + Gate outputs that can be used to sequence 1V/OCT synthesizers / modules. To enable the CV output ports, set the AUX OUT of any of Tracks to CV1 or CV2. The CV and GATE outputs on NGEN have a limited range of 3.3V and a resolution of 12bits so we recommend using an external MIDI to CV converter for a wider range and better resolution. WARNING The CV and Gate jacks are OUTPUTS only. Do not send any CV signals into them or you may run the risk of damaging your unit. Please note that NGEN still needs to be powered via USB (check the Powering NGEN section below). Powering NGEN externally If you'd like to set up NGEN without a computer, you can power it using a USB power bank / battery or a standard USB wall charger. NGEN's power consumption is minimal so even a 0.5A charger should work. Note Because of NGEN's low power consumption, certain USB power banks can dismiss it as an actively charging device and may turn off after a certain period. If this happens, try using a different power bank or a USB wall charger. I2C Connection NGEN features an 1/8 TRS I2C connection on it's left side wired with SDA on the TIP and SCL on RING. We plan on adding I2C-related features in future NGEN firmware updates. WARNING Do not connect any CV outputs or other signals via 1/8 to the I2C connection otherwise you may damage your unit.

Tips & Techniques Tips for Live Performance Here's a list of some tips that can help you get the most out of NGEN when performing live: Organizing your songs One way to organize song ideas is by utilizing the 8 available patterns within each project to store distinct sections of a song. For instance, you can use pattern 1 for the intro, pattern 2 for the verse, pattern 3 for the chorus, and so on. Additionally, projects can be used to store different songs. For example, you can use project 1 for song 1, project 2 for song 2, etc. NGEN is capable of loading projects and patterns while playing so you can use this to switch between songs and sections of a song while performing. Switching between different projects and patterns is always done in sync with the clock and it's designed to be as smooth as possible. Using shortcuts NGEN includes several shortcuts that can help you during your performance. A list of all shortcuts can be found in the Menu Navigation section of the manual. Using the Performance Mode The Performance Mode is a powerful tool for live performances. You can use it to control multiple parameters of different tracks at the same time. You could use the Performance Mode, for example, to control the density, octave, and mode of multiple tracks at once. Using an external MIDI controller for NGEN While NGEN may only feature 4 hardware knobs, it's possible to control most of its parameters and features via MIDI CC. This means that you can use an external MIDI controller to control NGEN's parameters and expand the number of real-time hardware controls available. If you have a MIDI controller with a 3.5mm MIDI jack, you can connect it to NGEN's MIDI IN jack. Controllers with MIDI DIN jacks can be connected to NGEN via a MIDI cable and a DIN to 3.5mm (Type-A) adapter. Because NGEN works as a USB client, USB MIDI Controller can only be used with a separate USB Host device or a computer (that forwards the MIDI messages from the controller to NGEN). A full list of NGEN's MIDI CC mappings can be found in the MIDI Mapping section of the manual. Automating parameter changes via MIDI CC The MIDI CC mappings can also be used to automate parameter changes via a DAW or other MIDI-capable device. This can be used to perform programmatic/automatic changes to NGEN's parameters (such as Key and Scale) according to the needs of your performance. Combining Multiple Tracks for 1 Instrument The standard workflow for NGEN is to utilize one track per instrument, but it's also possible to employ multiple tracks for the same instrument. This approach allows you to combine different Generators and MIDI FX to create more intricate and complex sequences. To achieve this, simply set the Output Channel of all tracks to the same value. From there, you can use the second track to add or modify the notes generated by the first track. Here's a list of some great combinations that we've found during our testing: DRUMGEN + Samba : DrumGen can be used to sequence the main elements of your drum section (kick, snare, hihats) while Samba can sequence other percussive elements. POP + Arper : In this combination, POP can be used to generate the main chord progression while Arper can be used to add a repeating arpeggio pattern on top of it. 2X ACDGEN : Two ACDGEN tracks can be combined to create more intricate sequences. Try setting the 2 ACDGEN tracks to different algorithms and/or octaves for more interesting results. Extra tips for combining multiple tracks: Use different clock rates for each track (1/16 and 1/8 for example). Explore contrasting settings for the generators. Use the available parameters to set different densities, octaves, and voicing modes (monophonic vs. polyphonic). Use MIDI FXs like the Shaper to control the velocity of the notes generated by each track. Using DRUMGEN and SAMBA to generate melodic sequences DrumGen and Samba are primarily designed to sequence percussive instruments however it's also possible to use them to generate interesting polyphonic sequences. Use the Note 1 through 4 parameters to set them to any other 4-note chord. The Note Length parameter in Samba allows you to switch between different length modes, which can have a significant impact when used with melodic instruments. Chaining MIDI FXs While NGEN only allows one MIDI FX per track, it's possible to chain multiple MIDI FXs by using the Aux Output of a track and the Thru Generator. To chain MIDI FXs, follow these steps: Select the track you'd like to chain MIDI FXs to. Set the MIDI FX of that track to the first MIDI FX you'd like to use. Set the Aux Output to another available track. Select the track that you set the Aux Output to and set its Generator to Thru. Set the MIDI FX of the Thru track to the next MIDI FX you'd like to use. Repeat these steps for each MIDI FX you'd like to chain. Attention Keep in mind that each track will continue to output MIDI to the selected Output Channel so, to avoid sending duplicate MIDI messages, set the Output Channel of each track to a different value.","title":"Tips & Techniques"},{"location":"techniques/#tips-techniques","text":"","title":"Tips &amp; Techniques"},{"location":"techniques/#about-this-section","text":"NGEN can be used in a variety of different ways and this section is designed to help you get started with some of the most common techniques.","title":"About this section"},{"location":"techniques/#tips-techniques_1","text":"","title":"Tips &amp; Techniques"},{"location":"techniques/#tips-for-live-performance","text":"Here's a list of some tips that can help you get the most out of NGEN when performing live:","title":"Tips for Live Performance"},{"location":"techniques/#organizing-your-songs","text":"One way to organize song ideas is by utilizing the 8 available patterns within each project to store distinct sections of a song.
